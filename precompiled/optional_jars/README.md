## Optional Jars

The folder "optional_jars" will be used as a volume due the large size it can achieve (with corenlp models and stuff). 

To use it, put your optional jars on a folder and mount it as a volume on the /root/IPED/optional_jars folder (Example: -v /mnt/optional_jars:/root/IPED/optional_jars).
